This readme describes how to use the files that come with UG480

            Readme  
Date        Version      Revision Description
=========================================================================
11/30/2013  2.0          Design has been changed to automatically read out measurements
=========================================================================


2. OVERVIEW
This document describes how to use the files that come with ug480.zip.

This archive contains an example design for instantiating XADC for an 8-Series design. 

The design shows an example of how to access the XADC data using the DRP ports. A small
state machine is used to intialize the XADC so that the averaging is disabled to speed up
simulation times. The initialization also shows the fundamental DRP writing and reading 
to Configuration Register 0 (40H).

After the XADC has been initialized the design's state machine will read all the registers
whenever EOS is active. The exact registers being used and the state machine can be modified
and adjusted to specific design needs.

3. SOFTWARE TOOLS AND SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
* Vivado 2014.1


To use this setup include: 
ug480.v/ug480.vhd and ug480.xdc are the only files needed to create an example that will automatically
read out the measured values after every end of sequence (EOS).

5. INSTALLATION AND OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS 
Vivado TCL commands to rebuild design using ug480.tcl
     1) Open Vivado
     2) In the TCL window
         source ug480_setup.tcl
         <ug480_create_project | ug480_run_project | ug480_sim_project>

The example design has been set for a specific device. Please adjust as needed and update the 
constraints to match. 

More specific customization of the analog stimulus file can be handled by placing
the stimulus file into the associated simulation directory as the System
Management Wizard does.
